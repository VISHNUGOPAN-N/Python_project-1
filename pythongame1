# it is a multiplayer game
# rolling dice game
# user can decide how many time the dice that he want's to roll.
# user get 1-6
# if a user get anything other than 1 you can roll how many times you need. you can do
# but if you get 1 then the score will be zero, you will lose all the score that you scored.
# there will be a score that the user needs to reach to win the game. it maybe 50, 100, whatever.
# the first user who reach the score  he will be the winner.

# let's start with random Module.
